## Overview

The project includes a Jupyter notebook that shows the math and Python to estimate the potential prevalence of an 
emergent fraud vector, as discussed in the post.

## Usage

- Browse the notebook to follow the step-by-step mathematical reasoning and Python code.
- Click on the Binder or Google Colab badges (icons) below to launch an interactive live version of the notebook in your browser without any setup.
